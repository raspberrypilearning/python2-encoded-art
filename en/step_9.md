## Share

If you are in a club, why not share your project with friends?

You could also show your family how your project works.

If you have a Trinket account, you can share your project through Trinket. You can send a link to people you know, and the whole Trinket community will be able to find your project and try it out.



Why not invite your friends to create a project? Let them know how you had fun.
